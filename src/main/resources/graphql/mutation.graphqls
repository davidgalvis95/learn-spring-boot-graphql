#This scalars are possible thanks to the ExtendedScalars library
#To make use of them we need to:
#1. Declare them in the root of the query/mutation schema, and then
#2. We will be able to make use of those inside the objects of the schema, e.g. CreateBankAccountInput input type
#3. Tell the system that we want to use a scalar of that type, and to do that we create a bean of that type
# as the one created in the ScalarConfig class
#To implement our own one we just need to implement the GraphQLScalarType interface
scalar NonNegativeInt
scalar DateTime
scalar Date

# All mutations available in graphql
type Mutation {
    # Create a bank account
    createBankAccount(input: CreateBankAccountInput!): BankAccount!
    # Upload a file
    uploadFile: ID!
